# This kernel is specifically is for Beginners who want's to experiment building CNN using Keras. By using this kernel, you can expect to get good score and also learn keras. 
# Keras is simple frameworks where we can initialize the model and keep stacking the layers we want. It makes building deep neural networks very easy.

# #Intro about the Data.
# 
# Sentinet -1 sat is at about 680 Km above earth. Sending pulses of signals at a particular angle of incidence and then recoding it back. Basically those reflected signals are called backscatter. The data we have been given is backscatter coefficient which is the conventional form of backscatter coefficient given by:
# 
# $σo (dB) = βo (dB) + 10log10 [ sin(ip) / sin (ic)] $
# 
# where
# 1. ip=is angle of incidence for a particular pixel
# 2. 'ic ' is angle of incidence for center of the image
# 3. K =constant.
# 
# We have been given $σo$ directly in the data. 
# ###Now coming to the features of $σo$
# Basically σo varies with the surface on which the signal is scattered from. For example, for a particular angle of incidence, it varies like:
# *             WATER...........           SETTLEMENTS........           AGRICULTURE...........          BARREN........
# 
# 1.**HH:**     -27.001   ................                     2.70252       .................                -12.7952        ................    -17.25790909
# 
# 2.**HV: **      -28.035      ................            -20.2665             ..................          -21.4471       .................     -20.019
# 
# As you can see, the HH component varies a lot but HV doesn't.
# **I don't have the data for scatter from ship, but being a metal object, it should vary differently as compared to ice object.**
# 
# ###WTF is HH HV?
# 
# Ok, so this Sentinal Settalite is equivalent to RISTSAT(an Indian remote sensing Sat) and they only Transmit pings in H polarization, **AND NOT IN V polarization**.  Those H-pings gets scattered, objects change their polarization and returns as a mix of H and V.
# **Since Sentinel has only H-transmitter, return signals are of the form of HH and HV only**. Don't ask why VV is not given(because Sentinel don't have V-ping transmitter).
# 
# Now coming to features, for the purpose of this demo code, I am extracting all two bands and taking avg of them as 3rd channel to create a 3-channel RGB equivalent. 
#

#Generate the training data
#Create 3 bands having HH, HV and avg of both

X_band_2=np.array([np.array(band).astype(np.float32).reshape(75, 75) for band in train["band_2"]])
X_train = np.concatenate([X_band_1[:, :, :, np.newaxis], X_band_2[:, :, :, np.newaxis],((X_band_1+X_band_2)/2)[:, :, :, np.newaxis]], axis=-1)

# That's a cool looking iceberg we have. Remember, in radar data, the shape of the iceberg is going to be like a mountain as shown in here. Since this is not a actual image but scatter from radar, the shape is going to have peaks and distortions like these. The shape of the ship is going to be like a point, may be like a elongated point. From here the structural differences arise and we can exploit those differences using a CNN. It would be helpful if we can create composite images using the backscatter from radar.

plotmy3d(X_band_1[14,:,:], 'Ship')


# That's a ship, looks like a elongated point. We don't have much resolution in images to visualize the shape of the ship. However CNN is here to help. There are few papers on ship iceberg classification like this:
# http://elib.dlr.de/99079/2/2016_BENTES_Frost_Velotto_Tings_EUSAR_FP.pdf
# However their data have much better resolution so I don't  feel that the CNN they used would be suitable here.

# Get back to building a CNN using Keras. Much better frameworks then others. You will enjoy for sure.

# #### Conclusion
# To increase the score, I have tried Speckle filtering, Indicence angle normalization and other preprocessing and they don't seems to work.  You may try and see but for me they are not giving any good results.
# 
# You can't be on top-10 using this kernel, so here is one beautiful peice of information. The test dataset contain 8000 images, We can exploit this. We can do pseudo labelling to increase the predictions. Here is the article related to that:
